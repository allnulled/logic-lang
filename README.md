## Logical Language for both: Humans and Machines.

The first version of this project was written in Spanish.

I started it because I think that we need more logic.

Without logic, we cannot be coherent.

And I appreciate coherency. When one is coherent, one can fail, but at least, it used the information it could get the best it could. 

Because remember that education must be paid still today in 2018. 

And not everyone can afford it.

And people can take advantage of the ignorance.

As usual, poor in a beautiful country. And getting old. Not proud, but who really cares. I got allergic to your greedy world.
