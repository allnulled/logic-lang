# Logic-Lang

## Logical Language for both: Humans and Machines.

Hello. Greed is, logically, the root of all human disgrace.

No greed, no cry.

And I will let you know it logically. The only escape will be to become ignorant, and to run away from logic. And that will make you as smart as a rat.

Rat, in Spanish, means greedy too. FYI.

Cheers.
